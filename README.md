Does what it says on the tin.

About 5 years ago my company had an internal wiki with a git page, and it had the ugliest banner that flased
just like this page that said "DON'T FORCE PUSH", and it's been burned into my head ever since.

That wiki has since passed onto the great information-graveyard in the sky, but I still wanted to link that
banner from time to time, so I created this page.
